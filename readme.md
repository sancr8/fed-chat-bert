# Federated Learning with Pre-trained Language Models

This repository contains Python scripts for federated learning with a pre-trained language model - using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project focuses on training a language model on decentralized data while preserving privacy and security.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- transformers==4.8.2
- torch==1.8.2
- torchvision==0.9.2
- pandas==1.3.3
- numpy==1.21.2
- scipy==1.7.3
- scikit-learn==0.24.2
- Flask==2.1.1 (Optional)

## Introduction

Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that allows model training on client devices while preserving data privacy and security. This project demonstrates federated learning using a pre-trained language model BERT.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:


You can install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/federated-learning.git
cd federated-learning
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies (see the requirements.txt file)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the federated learning settings in the `config.py` file, including the number of federated rounds, batch sizes, and learning rates.

5. Prepare your client and server data, and replace the sample data with your actual dataset. Prepare your dataset in CSV format and replace `dataset.csv` with your data. Make sure the dataset includes a 'text' column and a 'label' column.

6. Run the federated learning scripts (`client.py` and `server.py`) on separate machines or devices.

7. Implement secure communication between clients and the server for sending updates and model aggregation. Ensure that your server is configured to use HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for communication. HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.

8. Monitor the federated learning process and evaluate the final global model.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:
- checkpoint.py: This file contains the weights of a pre-trained language model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data. You can use any pre-trained language model checkpoint file such as BERT, GPT-2, or RoBERTa.
- config.py: This file contains the hyperparameters and settings for training the language model using federated learning. It includes parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and optimizer.
- client.py: This file contains the code for running the federated learning algorithm on each client device. It should include functions for loading the local dataset, computing gradients, and sending updates to the server.
- server.py: This file contains the code for aggregating the updates from all client devices and updating the global model. It should include functions for receiving updates from clients, averaging the gradients, and updating the model weights.
- client_data.py: This file contains the text data that will be used to fine-tune the pre-trained language model. The dataset should be split into training and validation sets. Sample cleint data (replace with your actual data)
- server_data.py: This file contains the text data that will be used to fine-tune the pre-trained language model. The dataset should be split into training and validation sets. Sample server data (replace with your actual data).
- script.py: This file contains the code for implementing the federated learning algorithm. It should include functions for loading the pre-trained checkpoint file, initializing the model, defining the loss function, and updating the model weights.
- app.py and index.html (Optional): Basic web-based chatbot involves integrating a chat interface with your federated learning model. Here's a simple example using Python, Flask, and JavaScript for the front-end. This example assumes you have a pre-trained language model checkpoint and server-side code for federated learning already set up.
- requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.
- README.md: Project documentation (this file).

## Usage
Please refer to the individual script files (client.py and server.py) for detailed usage instructions and adapt them to your specific federated learning scenario.
